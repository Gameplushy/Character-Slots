    This took about more than a year. Needless to say I''m happy that this finally
    has at least a working version.


    This module may have potential bugs in it, as not every single case has been tested.
    I apoligize in advance. If you want to help, please send me logfiles when you
    encounter bugs. Thank you again for your patience!


    This module may also have balancing issues (too easy at some points). I''ll try
    to fix some stuff if it doesn''t suit everyone''s taste.
